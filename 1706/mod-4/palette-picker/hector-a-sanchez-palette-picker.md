Completion

Were you able to complete the base functionality?

No, I had a really hard time understanding Knex, Express, and the whole backend in general.  I've had a lot of help from
the other students in my cohort and I'm feel as if I have a better understanding now, progress has been very slow for me and I'm
still working on the project.

Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
none

Code Quality

Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/index.js

Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Honestly, I'm kind of proud of everything that I wrote here, I know there can be
some refactoring, but after not having written jquery for a few months now, I feel proud
of the functionality I was able to implement with jquery.

happy code

Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/index.js

Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

On line 110, function appendProjectCard, this function to append a color palette is 
really long. I just feel like had I been using React I could've written
a much cleaner method of creating the color palette card.

sad code

Link to Design Inspiration

Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

I really like the design of the wireframe that was including in the palette picker spec, I spent a lot of time reviewing the lessons
on express and knex and I know I didn't devote too much time to UI research.  My UI is modeled after the wireframe that
is included in the palette picker, I felt that it was really easy to read and I really like it.
