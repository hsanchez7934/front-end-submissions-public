## Project Name: CitySnapshot

#### Check In: 4

#### Work done:
* Data cleaning class created and working to clean data
* Separated out CityCard from CityPage component for cleaner, more modular code
* Additional fetch created to grab a city summary
* City page styling completed, extras (like a sticky NAV) are pending time
* Comparison page completed
* CityList Buttons working and routing to correct page
* More tests added
* More styling added to make the UI more friendly


#### Issues:
* STILL having trouble figuring out how to give CityPage and CityList a path when it renders a city so it doesn't overlap with another route -- I've tried a few different methods (messaged you about it)
* Need to fix search navigation into the results DIV with the up/down arrow key (tricking the browser to jump into that DIV from the input field with a keypress)


#### Next Checkin-in
* Is there one tho?
