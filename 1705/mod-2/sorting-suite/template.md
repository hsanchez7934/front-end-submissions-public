Evaluation Rubric

## Fundamental JavaScript & Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
1: Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
0: Your client-side application does not function or the application does not make use of localStorage for updating information on the client. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.

## Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration. Arrays of random numbers and letters are generated to test the maximum number of elements which the algorithm can sort.
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality. Arrays of random numbers are generated to test the maximum number of elements which the algorithm can sort.
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

## Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

## Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
1: Application does not run, crashes on start.

## Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
3 - Five or fewer complaints
2 - Six to ten complaints
1 - More than ten complaints
