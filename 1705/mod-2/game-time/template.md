## Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
* 2 - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 1 - Application crashes during normal usage

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
* 1 - The application is confusing or difficult to use.

### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### JavaScript Style

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There are _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs.
* 1 - Your client-side application does not function. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps that do not increase clarity.
* 0 - There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 2 - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1 - The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0 - The application was not checked into version control.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
* 3 - Five or fewer complaints
* 2 - Six to ten complaints
* 1 - More than ten complaints
