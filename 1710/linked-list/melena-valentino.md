## Notes/What To Work On:

- Confusing for user that Enter button is red when disabled - try graying it out instead. Not clear that Delete Read button is actually a button due to design.
- Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
- Nice use of branches and commit messages on GitHub!
- Be sure indents are the same throughout in HTML file and that things are not double-indented Lines 13-17.
- YAY ARIA - alt, lables/inputs, semantic tags.
- Stick with one unit of measurement in CSS for consistency (em vs px) - stysheet has a mixture of both.
- Add commented code for organization in CSS files.
- JS file is easy to read and functions are single responsibility. No anonymous functions and good naming conventions. Both could speak to code.
