## Student: Natalie and Sabrina
## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp
* Consider mobile first in the future and definitely use the phone simulator to
  check mobile
* Make sure that the placeholder text is lighter than the value text

### html
* Good use of labels in html
* Html needs better use of indentation and a form instead of a section

### css
* Using vw for height, margin and padding properties felt strange to me - probably better to use rem, em, px or %

### js
* Avoid unused global variables(ie. cardCountValue is never used) 
* Work on spacing consistency in js - there should be spaces in between if and (

### git/github
* liked that there were a lot of commit messages, however in the future try to
  have them tell more of a story
