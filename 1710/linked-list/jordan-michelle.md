## Student: Jordan & Michelle
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Good error messaging.
- Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
- Following conventions for commiting but would like to see more than 3 branches for features.
- Good spacing/indentation in HTML. Small areas to push forward with ARIA - lang, alt attributes. Don't need to wrap labels around inputs if you are linking with for/id. Run through Chromevox or other screen reader next time.
- Good organization of CSS file!
- Nice work - no anonymous functions. You both have a clear understanding of event delegation. Both knew what code (including Regex) is doing.
- Longer functions in JS could be refactored.
- Remove all of your console logs for production ready code - JS line 15.
