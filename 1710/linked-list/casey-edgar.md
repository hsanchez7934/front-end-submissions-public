## Student: Casey and Edgar
## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp
* Great job implementing the comp! 
* Could improve ui by putting error messages under appropriate input fields

### html
* Work on more consistent spacing and indentation in html
* Always put script tags in the bottom of the body
* Looks like an unused jquery was install via npm
* Use labels around input fields instead of p tags

### css
* Try to avoid important flags 
* Break comma separated declarations onto multiple lines and only adding specific things to media queries
* No need for duplicate css - media queries screen size specifics only

### javascript
* Good use of global vs local variables
* Could use indentation and spacing combthrough
* Be more verbose when naming vars and functions 

### git/github
* Like that I'm seeing a lot of commits, but would like to see more commit messages and have those commits tell a story
