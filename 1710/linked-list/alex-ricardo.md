## Student: Alex & Ricardo
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Can tell there was definite thought put into the user experience by your error messaging, card counter, and clear button.
- Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes. Remove animations unless it contributes to functionality.
- YAY for tracking of issues on your Trello Board. Move over to Waffle so the issues are trackable on your GitHub repo.
- Good use of branches and comments on your PRs.
- Be sure to implement other pieces of ARIA - alt, lang, labels on inputs.
- Appreciate your clustering of related properties for organizing your CSS!
- Opportunities for refactoring in JS - long functions and some redundancy (118-140). Return is not neccessary for if/else blocks in inputValidator. Lines 43-45 don't appear to be doing anything. Both could speak to code.
