## Notes/What To Work On:

- great job coordinating
- great details, really nice UI additions
- not totally responsive, layout breaks at 320
- fix the little ribbon with the counter on stacked layout -- really nice UI choice, just make sure that its tight!
- massive eventListener -- refactor to small, single responsibility functions that can be called on click
