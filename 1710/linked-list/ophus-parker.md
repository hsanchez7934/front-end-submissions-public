## Student: Ophus & Parker
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Good error messaging.
- Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
- Love the focus returning to input on submission of form.
- HTML has unnecessary spacing that makes it hard to read.
- Counter for read cards/total card not intuitive for the user.
- YAY for ARIA and running it through Chromevox!
- Be sure to use hex codes and not the color names in CSS - you have a mix of both. Hex code offers support across all browsers.
- Add commented code for organization in CSS files.
- It is clear that you both know what each piece of the JS code is doing. Love your passion around digging into Regex.
- JS could use refactoring - especially displayError function.
