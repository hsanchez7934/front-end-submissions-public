## Student: Emily and Amy
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- used a constructor function to create cards! yay objects! awesome!
- css and HTML could use a clean up pass
- watch indentation
- make sure you're taking time to tidy up your code as you go. Details matter, and messy indentation, spacing, and unused lines of code make it look like you aren't being careful about what you're building (even if that isn't the case!)
- good job!
