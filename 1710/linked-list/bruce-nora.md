## Student: Bruce and Nora
## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:

### comp
* Pay more attention to detail on comp - ie. button should not have a border
radius

### html
* USE FORMS!!!!!!! Inputs should have labels!!!
* Html style is pretty solid, but still room for improvement in indentation(ie.
  line 20 should be indented)

### css
* Could use some organizational comments in css, no need for empty line at beginning of file
* Could consider using inline blocks instead of position absolute for desktop breakpoint
* Seeing hex and rgba values for colors - pick one or the other
* Check for duplicate lines in CSS and break out into class if possible

### js
* Be weary when using large ternaries
* Comments seem unnecessary/redundant
* Great job naming functions
* Try to only use global vars when absolutely necessary - could probably make
  some of global vars local in this project
* Be more consistent with spacing, indentation, and semicolons(each time block
  is nested should be indented two spaces or one tab)

### git/github
* Tell more of a story with commit messages, but love that I'm seeing a lot of
  commits
