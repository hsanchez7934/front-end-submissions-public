## Notes/What To Work On:

### html
* Indentation in html is almost there but could use another combthrough
* Labels should wrap or be above input fields
* Comments in html seem redundant for production code
* Would recommend using a minified version of jquery in future projects for faster load times

### css
* No need for duplicate css - media queries screen size specifics only
* Try to avoid using negative values in css

### js
* Cool to see that you used both function expressions and declarations, but pick
  one or the other in the future
* Would like to see more consistency and diligence with spacing, indentation,
  and semicolons
* lines 34 and 35 should be moved toward top as they are currently floating in
  no mans land
* Would like to see more verbose names of vars and functions and more verb like
  function names
  * ie. `urlInputValidator()` could be renamed to `validateUrl()`

### git/github
* Would like to see more verbose commit messages and have those commits tell
  more of a story

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
