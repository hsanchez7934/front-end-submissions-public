- Yay for two player!
- Minor polishing with design but stays true to spirit of comp
- Be sure to use error messaging so that user receives clear message as to why certain data (letters or being outside of the range) isn't being accepted  - this was part of the reqs of Phase 2
- Good start for organizing CSS
- Nice naming in JS. Some longer functions that you use refactoring
