## Notes/What To Work On:

- make sure you understand your entire codebase. it is better to get less of the functionality built and really understand all of it that to get a lot of built but not be able to confidently speak to what you've done.
- force yourself to use vanilla JS -- don't rely on jQuery for everything. jQuery is a tool that is helpful, but you can't use it in every situation and having a solid handle on plain ol' javascript is very important.
