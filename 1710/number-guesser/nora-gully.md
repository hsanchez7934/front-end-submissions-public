## Notes/What To Work On:

- break out single responsibility functions
- JS is in a good place for a refactor pass
- overall, make sure you're mindful of small details like spacing, indentation, and DRY code.
- it is great that you're comfortable trying things out and experimenting. Make sure you give yourself a little time to tidy things up and really understand how all the parts work together, too.
- yay unicorns!
