## Notes/What To Work On:

- Nice use of error messaging! Very easy to follow what was going, from a user standpoint
- Good nesting in HTML. Be sure to incorporate ARIA labels into markup
- Good start for organization in CSS stylesheet with alphabetizing declarations
- Know your code. Practice speaking about the technical parts of your code to yourself and others. It is important that you can speak to what pieces of code are doing and why (e.g. parseInt, == vs ===)
