## Notes/What To Work On:

- if you want to add fun features, build them yourself. Having fun and playing with code is a fantastic way to learn, but pulling in something you found online and don't fully understand isn't teaching you anything.
- really consider how the structural choices you make impact your layout and how it behaves on different screen sizes.
