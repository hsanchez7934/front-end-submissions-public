## Student: Parker
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- has a dropdown for a user selected min and max!
- has it on github!
- is rebasing!
- UI gets really spread out vertically on large screens
- lots of absolutely positioned elements. This isn't a very maintainable approach to positioning and can lead to some frustrating layout bugs.
- great job experimenting and trying things out!!! You're very willing to try out different approaches and techniques and do a very good job researching and understanding what you're trying.
