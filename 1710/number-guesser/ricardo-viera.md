## Student: Ricardo
## Evaluator: Louisa and David
## Notes/What To Work On:

- watch spacing and indentation in HTML, CSS, and JS
- interesting slider to select range, but used a slider that was found online and didn't build it from scratch. Didn't fully understand how it was hooked up and how it worked. Disappointed to see that what could have been the most interesting part of this app was something that you didn't build yourself or completely understand.
- don't make excuses for the state/status of your work. What you bring to an eval is what we care about. We are reviewing and discussing what you actually did, not what you intended to do, and the reasons why something isn't fully flushed out (unless there was an real emergency you were dealing with) are irrelevant.
