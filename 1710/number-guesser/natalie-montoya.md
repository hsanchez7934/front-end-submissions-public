## Student: Natalie Montoya
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Pretty solid recreation/design of the comp - very minor details to make it pixel perfect
- Be mindful of making information/directions digestable for the user. The less they have to think, the better! 
- Works towards eliminating redundancy in CSS. Use shorthand when applicable
- JS is easy to follow. Could use a refactor pass for longer functions
